# Sum-of-Consecutives
Some times we face an algebric mathimatical problem says:
"Find two consecutive numbers whose sum is 57"

The solution would be easy, we need to create a linear equation (data model) to solve the problem:
let x = first numbee
then  x + 1 represents the second number
first number + second number  = 57 (given by the problem)
x + (x+1) = 57 (replace first number with x and second number with x + 1)
2x + 1 = 57 (simplify the equation)
2x = 56 (subtract 1 from both sides)
x = 28 (divide both sides by 2)
The first number is 28, and the second number is x+1 = 29
and that was the solution mathimatically.

Recape: we have created a mathimatical data model to solve the equation.
